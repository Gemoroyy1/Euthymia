# Euthymia
Telegram bot for university studies that contains all uploaded lectures and practices and lives in a group chat of that university.

Basically I know nothing from the start: how to create a telegram bot, how to create PostgreSQL data base, how to connect them and etc.
In case my solutions make your eyes bleed - please, feel free to help this project.
I will update and support it right until I say I stop.
